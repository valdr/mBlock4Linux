# Here I will start documenting the fixed blocks in the mBlock IDE, as seen in mBlock on Android.
# Any help is welcome, discussion is appreciated.
# mBlock4Linux, like Linux is Open Source. Which is nothing if not with collaboration.

# MOVE group
# This group has 6 controls that can be programmed:
## JOYSTICK
## QUAD DIRECTION PAD
## BUTTON
## ON/OFF Switch
## SLIDER for DC Motor 1
## SLIDER for DC Motor 2


## run <direction> at speed <int>
### Directions:
   # Forward
   # Backward
### Speeds:
   # 0 - n (word, long word?)

## turn <direction> at speed <int>
### Direction: 
   # left
   # right
### Speeds:
   # 0 - n (word, long word?)

## set dc motor <motor> at speed <int>
### motors:
   # M1
   # M2
### Speeds:
   # 0 - n (word, long word?)
   
## set servo motor <port> slot <int> to degree <degree>
### ports:
   # 1-4 (or is that 0-3?)
### slots:
   # 1 & 2 (0 & 1?)
### degrees: 
   # like speed, it pops up a numberpad of sorts, and seemingly any integer is acceptable...
